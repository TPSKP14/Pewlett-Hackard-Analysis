PURPOSE
The Purpose of the project was to determine how many employees were going to eligible for retirement.  In the process, also analyzing each potential retiree's salary, department, title and other attributes that would effect how Pewlett-Hackard would operate. We also looked at which employees were eligible for mentorship in order to potentially match them with the individuals who were eligible for retirement.

THE RESULTS.
Over 90,000 employees are eligible for retirement, though most of them are consolidated in the senior engineer and senior staff roles.  Only 2 managers have reached retirement age.  Since the majority of individuals that are of retirement age are in senior roles, they would be ideal candidates to lead the mentorship program

CONCLUSION
Hewlett Packard is undergoing a massive transitional stage due to the large nujmber of employees are at retirement age.  The mentorship program is being timed well and should be quickly implemented
